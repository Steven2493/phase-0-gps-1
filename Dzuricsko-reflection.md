What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? 

- I was still a little confused about the dual functions of adding and committing files. I also had had some difficulty with merging branches in my practice leading up to the GPS.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- Blake was very helpful with his answer to our add and commit question. He also did a good job of explaining the GPS process. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
- We asked about the ability to add files without committing. We also asked for clarification on backing upt the master branch.
What still confuses you about Git?
- I'm still a little uneasy about the difference between the local and Github and how that modifies files in each location. 
-Merging branches and resolving conflicts is also still a challenge.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
-I really enjoyed it. I was nervous going in to the GPS, because I didn't really know what to expect. I'm greatful for the pairing and am much more comfortable.
